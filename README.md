# cthayes-api
A Rest API built with NodeJS & Koa that serves data to http://cthayes.net


## Prereqs
You'll need to install NodeJS and npm. The Git cli is optional, but makes it easy to download the repo.

## Installation
In a terminal enter the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/cthayes/cthayes-api.git
cd cthayes-api
npm install
```


## Usage 

```
npm start
```

This will start the server on port 8080. You can optionally pass a port number as an argument:

```
npm start 3000
```

You should now see JSON data at http://localhost:8080/experiences and http://localhost:8080/education
